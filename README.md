# Simple Data Pipe Connector for Reddit

[Simple Data Pipe](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/simple-data-pipe/) connector for [Reddit Ask Me Anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/ama). This connector fetches a limited number of Reddit comments for a post, uses the [Watson Tone Analyzer API](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/tone-analyzer/api/v3/) to determine the sentiment and stores the results using the [Simple Data Pipe SDK](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/simple-data-pipe-sdk) in Cloudant. 

Sample use-case:
[Analyze Reddit comments using Apache Spark](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/2016/03/10/sentiment-analysis-of-reddit-amas/)

### Pre-requisites

##### Deploy the Simple Data Pipe

  [Deploy the Simple Data Pipe in Bluemix](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/simple-data-pipe) using the Deploy to Bluemix button or manually.

##### Services

This connector requires the [Watson Tone Analyzer service](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/tone-analyzer) in IBM Bluemix to be bound to the Simple Data Pipe application. 

[Provision and bind](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/simple-data-pipe/wiki/Provision-and-bind-a-service-instance-in-Bluemix) a _Watson Tone Analyzer service_ instance. If you're using Cloud Foundry, do so by running the following commands:

````
  $ cf create-service tone_analyzer beta "tone analyzer"
  $ cf bind-service simple-data-pipe "tone analyzer"
  $ cf restage simple-data-pipe
````

> Pro Tip: If you want to re-use an existing instance that is not named `tone analyzer`, create a [USER-DEFINED Environment Variable](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/manageapps/depapps.html#ud_env) in the Simple Data Pipe application named __WATSON_TONE_ANALYZER__ and set its value to the name of the existing Tone Analyzer service. [Read how](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/simple-data-pipe/wiki/Create-a-user-defined-environment-variable-in-Bluemix).
